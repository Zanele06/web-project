     <h3><p>Miraculous my stories write stories to entertain children all over the globe. Our stories are based on the "miraculous tales of ladybug and cat noir" show, as we use their characters, settings and images.
        <p>A lot of children enjoy watching Laybug and cat noir as they are very entertaining, even if you don't know ladybug and can noir but i can assure you that you are going to love these stories. We also think that these stories are a great way to keep our choldren busy. They also get to tell us what they think of the previous story they read. They can even send us what they think about the character's attitude.

     <h3><p>Children also get to write their own stories with their names on them. Their stories don't have to be about the miraculous characters. Our mission is to entertain children, improve their reading skills and to give them a kick start if they are into wtiting stories.
     <p>We believe that there are a lot of authors out there but they don't know where to began we make that easy for them. Children can write a lot of amazing stories because of their imagination, they have a very strong imagination that they can use to write these stories.</h3>
